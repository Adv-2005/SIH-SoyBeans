        <p>Electronic devices can not and should not be placed in the trash can with your normal waste. Along with the
            damage that can be caused to our environment, you could possibly be fined for doing this. Many recycling
            centers will accept electronic
            devices such as computers, printers, laptops, stereos, small appliances, and pretty much anything with a
            circuit board. You can search on this site to find a local facility that will accept your e-waste. An added
            benefit that many people are
            not aware of is that some facilities also will pay you cash for your old electronics because the circuit
            boards have small amounts of precious metals contained in them.</p>

        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.... Three weeks later, the Avengers reunite after
            Stark and Nebula are rescued by Danvers. The Avengers find Thanos' location, where Rogers, Romanoff, Banner,
            Thor, Danvers, Rhodes, Rocket,
            and Nebula ambush him. Thanos reveals he destroyed the Stones, prompting Thor to decapitate him.[26] By
            2023, Romanoff becomes the leader of the Avengers, officially recruiting Danvers, Rocket, and Nebula to the
            team. The Avengers collaborate
            with Okoye to mitigate the Blip's damage. Rogers becomes a grief counselor, Stark lives with his wife Pepper
            Potts and daughter Morgan, Thor becomes an overweight alcoholic afflicted with depression, while Banner
            merges his intelligence within
            the Hulk's body. Lang escapes the Quantum Realm and visits Rogers and Romanoff at the Compound, proposing to
            use the Quantum Realm for time travel to undo the Blip. They visit Stark and Banner to discuss it, but Stark
            rejects it while Banner's
            tests fail. Stark eventually helps them, providing Pym Particles for time traveling. Banner and Rocket
            travel to New Asgard, Norway to recruit Thor, while Romanoff recruits Barton in Tokyo. They all reconvene
            and form a plan to conduct a time
            traveling operation to retrieve each Stone from the best years and locations.[26][30] Banner, Rogers, Stark,
            and Lang travel to New York City in 2012: Banner gets the Time Stone from the Ancient One after revealing
            Strange's surrendering of
            it, Lang finds the Mind Stone in Loki's scepter, while Stark and Rogers fail to get the Space Stone, but get
            it by going back to 1970. Thor and Rocket retrieve the Reality Stone from Asgard, while Rhodes and Nebula
            retrieve the Power Stone
            from Morag in 2013 and 2014 respectively. 2023-Nebula is replaced with 2014-Nebula to sabotage the operation
            as 2014-Thanos manages to kidnap 2023-Nebula, learning of the Blip and the Avengers' plan to undo it. Barton
            gets the Soul Stone after
            Romanoff sacrifices herself on Vormir.[26][31] Reuniting in 2023, the Avengers place the Stones into the
            newly-made Nano Gauntlet. Then, Banner snaps with the gauntlet on, undoing the Blip. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula
            transports 2014-Thanos, his
            warship, and 2014-Gamora to 2023, destroying the Avengers Compound. 2023-Nebula kills 2014-Nebula after
            failing to convince her to betray Thanos. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor, and Rogers and directs his army to
            obtain the Stones, intent on
            creating a new "grateful" universe. Strange creates portals, allowing the restored Avengers and their allies
            to arrive to fight Thanos and his army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos' warship, but he overpowers
            her in a confrontation
            and seizes the Nano Gauntlet. Stark eventually confronts Thanos and wields the Stones, snapping to
            disintegrate Thanos and his army, but the strain kills Stark.[26][32] Disbanding Following Stark's funeral,
            the Avengers disband. Rogers returns
            the Stones to their proper timelines and reunites with Peggy Carter. Rogers, now an old man, returns and
            grants his shield and title of Captain America to Wilson.[33] Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new ruler of New
            Asgard and goes to space
            with the Guardians.[26][34] Afterwards, Fury sends Skrulls to collect blood samples on the battlefield,
            combining it into one concoction known as the Harvest.[35][36] Banner, living in Mexico, aids his cousin
            Jennifer Walters after she receives
            his abilities following a blood cross-contamination in a car accident.[37] Banner then travels to Sakaar to
            bring his son Skaar to Earth.[38][39][40] Barton retires and lives with his family at their Iowa farm. He
            mentors a protégé named Kate
            Bishop, whom he saved during the Battle of New York.[41][42] In 2025, the first annual "AvengerCon" is held
            at Camp Lehigh to honor the Avengers.[43][44] Lang becomes a celebrity while spending time with his family,
            starts the Big Me Little
            Me podcast, and writes his bestselling memoir Look Out for the Little Guy. Lang, his daughter Cassie, Hope,
            Pym, and Janet are transported into the Quantum Realm where they encounter Kang the Conqueror, who forces
            Lang to help him escape.
            They successfully kill Kang and return home. However, the Council of Kangs, overseeing the multiverse, notes
            that Earth-616's Avengers are becoming aware of the multiverse and must be stopped.[45][46] Alternate
            versions Other versions of the
            Avengers are depicted within the context of the MCU multiverse. What If...? (2021–present) Main article:
            What If...? (TV series) In an alternate 2011, a vengeful Hank Pym eliminates the Avengers' candidates:
            Stark, Thor, Barton, Banner, and
            Romanoff. After Pym is defeated, Loki proceeds to invade Earth. Meanwhile, Fury prepares to recreate the
            team after Rogers is discovered in the Arctic and Danvers responds to his call.[47] Rogers, Danvers, and
            Fury later battle Loki and his
            Asgardian army aboard a Helicarrier. During the fight, the Watcher brings in a variant of Romanoff, and she
            incapacitates Loki with his scepter.[48] In an alternate 2018, a quantum virus is released turning people
            into zombies. Some of the
            Avengers respond to an outbreak in San Francisco and are infected as well. Banner and Parker survive, and
            with other allies, find Vision and Maximoff, with Vision taking care of an infected Maximoff. Vision
            sacrifices himself to provide the
            Mind Stone to find a cure, while Banner stays behind to keep Maximoff at bay, allowing Parker, T'Challa, and
            Lang to escape to Wakanda where an infected Thanos awaits with the other Infinity Stones.[49] In an
            alternate 2015, Ultron successfully
            implants himself into Vision's body and exterminates the Avengers, except for Barton and Romanoff. Years
            later, Ultron begins a campaign of destruction across the universe after obtaining the Infinity Stones,
            while Barton and Romanoff fight
            Ultron's sentries. They attempt to shutdown Ultron and eventually prepare to upload an analog copy of Arnim
            Zola's consciousness into Ultron's hivemind, but Barton sacrifices himself in vain as the upload fails when
            Ultron enters the multiverse.[50]
            Other universes A version of the Avengers existed on Earth-838 where Peggy Carter / Captain Carter became
            the first member.[51][52] In an alternate 2018, the Avengers and Thanos are killed during the Battle of
            Wakanda when Glenn Talbot / Graviton,
            attempting to draw up enough gravitonium to help the Avengers defeat Thanos, accidentally causes the planet
            to explode.[53][54] In several alternate universes, the Avengers were killed by Kang, who successfully
            conquered their respective universes.[45]
